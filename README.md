# Hi üëã My name is Adie Nunn

## Software Engineer

I come from an arts background but, in a shocking plot twist, switched careers in 2023. I'm now a full-time, full-stack web developer. Hooray! My current obsession in my spare time is AI/ML/LLMs (alphabet soup is my favourite dish), as well as exploring the intersection of tech and the arts. When I'm not coding I like gaming, writing, going for long walks and wistfully staring at peoples' houseboats.

[LetChat Frontend](https://github.com/cowtipping/Git-Gud-LetChat-Frontend)  
[LetChat Backend](https://github.com/cowtipping/Git-Gud-LetChat-Backend)

An app to facilitate better communication between landlords and tenants.  
I contributed to all of the design process from ideation to user stories to Figma designs. I also implemented user authentication/authorisation with Firebase, wrote components, front and backend tests, documentation and added accessibility.  
We worked in a team of six in an Agile way doing weekly sprints and I lead some of the daily standups and retros.

Tech:

- NextJS

<details><summary>Just The Ticket - School Of Code Week 9 Project</summary>

[Just The Ticket Frontend](https://github.com/cowtipping/Just-The-Ticket-Frontend)  
[Just The Ticket Backend](https://github.com/cowtipping/Just-The-Ticket-Backend)

The task was to develop something to help fellow bootcampers. We noticed people were generally quite bad at asking questions (no offence), often just popping a question in Slack like "help needed in room 30". We designed the app to help people ask better questions - what's the problem, what have you tried so far, give us some code, give us any error messages.  
I worked on the design and ideation, set up the initial shell of the app, got basic state and data-fetching functionality working in React and wrote all the frontend tests and a few integration tests.  
The idea was it should be like a friendlier version of Stack Overflow but really it's more like a ticketing system, hence the name (a coooool pun).

Tech:

- React
- Express
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Supertest

<details><summary>Lootbox Simulator</summary>

[Lootbox Simulator](https://github.com/cowtipping/lootbox-simulator)

Just a dumb thing I made in an afternoon when I was bored. Look, I'm a gamer. I just like to click on things.  
It was my first time setting up a React app with Vite so it was also a good opportunity to give Vitest a go.

Tech:

- React
- TypeScript
- Cypress
- Vitest

<details><summary>Click The Nuclear Waste</summary>

[Click The Nuclear Waste](https://github.com/cowtipping/clicker)

An early side-project to help me learn React. I was struggling a bit with the intial React concepts when learning them at School Of Code so I made something to help cement them in my head.  
It's basically a simple [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) clone.

Tech:

- React

<details><summary>Who's That Pokemon?</summary>

[Who's That Pokemon?](https://github.com/cowtipping/whos-that-pokemon)

The PokeAPI is the best API. FACT.  
An early project to play with APIs. I keep coming back to it from time to time to give it little updates. It's the project which won't die.

Tech:

- Originally vanilla JavaScript, converted to TypeScript
