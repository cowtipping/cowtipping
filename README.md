# Hi 👋 My name is Adie Nunn

## Software Engineer

I come from an arts background but, in a shocking plot twist, switched careers in 2023. I'm now a full-time, full-stack web developer. Hooray! When I'm not coding I like gaming, going for long walks, and rummaging around castle ruins.

### Current Projects

At work: I do stuff with databases and AWS.  
At home: Playing with game engines.

### Skills

#### Stuff I've Used Quite A Lot

- Python
- JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.JS, Node
